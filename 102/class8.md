# What is an expression in JavaScript?
In JavaScript, an expression is any valid unit of code that can be evaluated to a value. Examples of expressions include:

- Arithmetic expressions: 2 + 3, 4 * 5, etc.
- String expressions: "hello" + "world", "The answer is " + 42, etc.
- Logical expressions: `true && false`, `!(1 === 2)`, etc.
- Object expressions: `{ name: "John", age: 30 }`, `{} (an empty object)`, etc.
- Function expressions: `function add(a, b)` `{ return a + b; }`, `()` => `"Hello World!"`, etc.

# Why would we use a loop in our code?

We use loops in our code to repeat a block of code multiple times. Loops are a fundamental programming construct that allow us to write efficient and concise code that can perform repetitive tasks.

# When does a for loop stop executing?

A for loop in JavaScript stops executing when the loop condition becomes false. The loop condition is checked at the beginning of each iteration, and if it is false, the loop terminates and control passes to the next statement after the loop.

Here is the basic syntax for a for loop:
```
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
  // code to be executed
}
```

# How many times will a while loop execute?

The number of times a while loop will execute depends on the condition specified in the loop. The loop will continue executing as long as the condition is true, and it will terminate as soon as the condition becomes false.
