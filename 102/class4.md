# What is HTML and why do we use it?
- HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is the main markup language used to create web pages.

# We use HTML for the following main reasons:

- **To structure and format web page content**- HTML allows you to format text, add headings, lists, tables, etc. This helps to logically structure your content and present it in a readable format.

- **To add images, multimedia and interactive elements** - You can add images, videos, audio, hyperlinks, buttons, forms, etc. to make interactive and engaging web pages.

- **To create semantic page layouts** - Using HTML elements like `<header>, <footer>, <section>, <article>, <aside>` etc. allows you to define different semantic sections of a page and keep the code clean and structured.

# What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element?


An HTML element consists of 3 main parts:

- Opening tag: <element>
The opening tag contains the element name surrounded by angle brackets. For example, <h1> is the opening tag for a heading element.

- Content: Some elements contain content between their opening and closing tags. For example, a paragraph element <p> contains paragraph text content. Not all elements contain content though.

- Closing tag: </element>
The closing tag contains a forward slash followed by the element name surrounded by angle brackets. For example, </h1> is the closing tag for a heading element.

A basic HTML element looks like this:
<element>content</element>

So the 3 main parts of an HTML element are:

The opening tag
The content (optional)
The closing tag

# What is it called when you give an element extra information?

When you provide additional information about an HTML element in the form of attributes, it is called element attributes.

# What is a semantic element?

A semantic element is an HTML element whose meaning is clearly defined. It provides a context for the information being marked up.

Some key points about semantic elements:

- They clearly define the meaning and purpose of content, rather than just how it is presented. For example, <h1> defines a level one heading, not just large, bold text.

- They make code easier to read and navigate because the meaning is more obvious. This has benefits for both humans and machines.

- They are more accessible as they convey meaning rather than just presentation. Screen readers can interpret semantic markup more accurately.

- They improve SEO because search engines can better understand the content and its hierarchy.

Examples of semantic elements include:

`<h1> to <h6> for headings
<p> for paragraphs
<ul> and <ol> for lists
<form> for [interactive forms]`

Some more abstract semantic elements include:

<div> and <span> which provide no inherent meaning, only layout/formatting. They should be used sparingly.
<header>, <footer>, <section>, <article>, <aside> which provide enhanced document outline meaning.
