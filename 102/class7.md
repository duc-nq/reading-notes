# What is `control flow`?
`Control flow` refers to the order in which instructions are executed in a program.
# What is a JavaScript `function`?
A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular action. It allows you to organize your code in a reusable manner.
Some key points about JavaScript functions:

They are defined using the function keyword.
They can take parameters (inputs) and return outputs.
They can be stored in variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned from functions.
They help avoid writing repetitive code by encapsulating reusable logic.

A simple JavaScript function looks like this:
`function sayHello() {`
`console.log('Hello!');`
`}`
# What does it mean to `invoke` - or `call` - a function?
Invoking and calling a function essentially mean the same thing - executing the function.
# What are the parenthesis `()` for when you define a function?
***The parentheses () after a function definition have two purposes:***
They group the function parameters (inputs) together.
They allow you to specify what data type the function returns.
