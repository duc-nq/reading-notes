## What are four important features to look for in a text editor?
1. **Syntax highlighting**: A good text editor should provide syntax highlighting for various programming languages. This feature makes it easier to read and understand code by visually distinguishing different elements, such as keywords, variables, and comments, using color schemes.

2. **Auto-completion**: Auto-completion is a feature that suggests possible completions for words or code snippets as you type. This can greatly improve your coding efficiency and reduce typing errors by minimizing the amount of manual typing required.

3. **Customizability**: A text editor should be customizable to meet your specific needs. This may include the ability to change the appearance (fonts, colors, themes) or modify key bindings and shortcuts. Some text editors also support plugins or extensions, which allow you to add additional features and functionality.

4. **File and project management**: A good text editor should provide efficient file and project management capabilities. This may include features like file search, file navigation, project-wide search and replace, and integration with version control systems like Git.

## What do the following commands do?
- `pwd`   : displays the present working directory
- `ls`    : list the files and directories in the current directory.
- `cd`    : cd stands for "change directory". It is used to navigate to another directory in the filesystem.
- `mkdir` : mkdir stands for "make directory". It is used to create new directories in the filesystem.
- `touch` : touch is used to create or update the access and modification times of a file.
## Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)
- `cd projects` : change current directory into `projects`
- `mkdir new-project` : make a new directory with name is `new-project`
- `touch new-project/newfile.md`: make a new file newfile.md on new-project directory
- `cd ..` : is used to go up one directory level in the filesystem.
- `ls projects/new-project` : That command ls projects/new-project will list the contents of the projects/new-project directory.
