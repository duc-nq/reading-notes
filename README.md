# ACL - Growth Mindset
**Ngo Quang Duc**
> Growth mindset is the belief that one's abilities, intelligence, and talents can be developed and improved through hard work, dedication, and persistence.

***Three reminders to yourself of how to keep yourself in a growth mindset***

1. 'Embrace challenges and learn from setbacks' : Remind yourself that challenges are opportunities for growth and development. When you face a setback or failure, view it as feedback and a chance to learn, adapt, and improve. Reflect on what went wrong, identify areas for improvement, and create a plan to move forward.

2. 'Focus on effort and persistence, not just talent' : Recognize that effort and hard work are key factors in achieving success. Instead of attributing success to innate talent, remind yourself that consistent effort, practice, and perseverance are essential for growth and improvement. Praise your own efforts and progress, and seek opportunities to further develop your skills.

3. 'Be open to feedback and maintain a curious mindset' : Actively seek feedback from others and be open to constructive criticism. Remember that growth occurs when we are willing to learn from our mistakes and the experiences of others. Cultivate a curious mindset by asking questions, seeking new perspectives, and exploring new ideas and concepts. This will help you to stay engaged, motivated, and eager to grow.
